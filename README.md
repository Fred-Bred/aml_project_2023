Group Project Assignment AML(ITU 2023)

## Learning Goals
In parallel to working towards the general learning objectives of the Advanced Machine Learning Course, you are intended to

- Solve an interesting problem,
- Implement and apply a recent machine learning method,
- Evaluate and report the method performance.

## Timeline - Overview
* 06.11.2023 Deadline for your own project description xor choice of pre-defined project (any time earlier is possible and encouraged) 
* 08.11.2023 Project Kick-Off (after the lectures)
* 22.11.2023 Supervision meeting (mandatory)
* 06.12.2023 Project sharing round (mandatory)
* 08.01.2024 Project report hand-in (mandatory)
* 23.-24.01.2024 Oral exams (includes your project)

  ## Problem Statement
To reach our learning goals, your task as a group is to:

* understand a chosen problem, select appropriate (existing and recent) dataset(s), and understand feasible existing solutions (the *state of the art*), 
* select and implement (at least) one machine learning method - as a general rule, you may take code pieces from existing repositories/exercises/papers as long as you understand and can explain that code, and cite it, 
* evaluate and report your solution for appropriate measure w.r.t. your chosen problem (e.g. accuracy/performance, edge cases, model behaviour) - and discuss/reflect peculiar strengths and weaknesses.

As optional additional steps, we highly encourage you to (and/or):
* expand a solution with your own original ideas, 
* transfer your solution onto different datasets (potentially from different domains),
* experiment with novel approaches to add insight/explainability about the models' decisions.

For this, you can either select one of the prepared projects below or create your own.
